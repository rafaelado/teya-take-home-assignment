## Assumptions

The following assumptions were made to support implementation and interpretation of the API:

- A single user can own multiple accounts.
- Users are allowed to deposit money into their own accounts, effectively **creating money from nothing**.
- Users can withdraw money from their accounts, effectively **removing money from the system**.
- Users can transfer money **between any two accounts**, even if both accounts belong to the same user.
- A `user-id` is added to the **request headers** to simulate authentication and identify the user making the request. IT IS MANDATORY
- The use of `user-id` in headers is a design decision to **avoid deeply nested endpoints** like `/users/:userId/accounts/...`.
